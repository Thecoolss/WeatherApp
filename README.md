# WeatherApp
This is a simple weather app built in Python that fetches real-time data from an API

It asks for user input and then displays the weather temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, an emoji depicting the weather condition, and a small description.

Source of real-time data: https://openweathermap.org/

Hope you like it! (:
